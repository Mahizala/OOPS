Imagine a class as a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of a particular type of entity. An object, then, is a specific entity created from that blueprint.

For instance, if you have a class Animal, you could create subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird, as these are all types of animals."],"metadata":{"id":"p1k4aFEH7twW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q7.**What is Polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","-->Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.

It restricts direct access to some components, protecting data integrity. This is achieved through:\n","\n","Name Mangling: Prefixing attributes with __ (e.g., __value) makes them \"private,\" hindering direct access.\n","\n","Getter/Setter Methods: Controlled access to attributes via methods like get_value() and set_value().\n","\n","Convention: Using a single underscore (_) prefix to suggest \"protected\" status (not strictly enforced).\n","\n","Encapsulation enhances data protection, improves code maintainability, and promotes modularity."],"metadata":{"id":"LDLqvWimDk64"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q9.**What is constructor in python?\n","\n","-->In Python, a constructor is a special method named __init__ that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. Its primary function is to initialize the object's attributes with initial values. The __init__ method typically takes at least one parameter, self, which refers to the instance of the class being created. Additional parameters can be passed to provide initial values for the object's attributes. This allows you to set up the object with its initial state, ensuring it's ready for use upon creation. Constructors are essential for proper object initialization and play a crucial role in the object-oriented programming paradigm."],"metadata":{"id":"fMaNwdJ1FM0K"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q10.**What are class and static methods in python?\n","\n","-->In Python, a class acts as a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes (variables) and methods (functions). Each object created from a class is an instance of that class. Static methods, on the other hand, are associated with the class itself rather than with specific objects. They are declared using the @staticmethod decorator and do not have access to the self parameter, which represents the instance. Static methods are often used for utility functions that don't rely on the object's state, such as mathematical calculations or general helper functions. This distinction between instance methods and static methods provides flexibility in how you organize and use methods within your Python classes."],"metadata":{"id":"CwkTho3iF5cY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q11.**What is method overloading in python?\n","\n"," -->Python doesn't directly support method overloading in the traditional sense where methods with the same name but different parameter types are distinguished. This is due to Python's dynamic typing. However, you can achieve similar behavior using workarounds like default arguments, which allow you to define methods with optional parameters, and variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs), which enable you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a single method. Additionally, type hints can improve code readability by indicating the expected types of arguments and return values, although they don't enforce type checking at runtime. While not true method overloading, these techniques provide flexibility in how you define and call methods in Python."],"metadata":{"id":"-IP-wrE5GajB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q12.**What is method overriding in python?\n","\n","-->Method overriding in Python is a key principle of object-oriented programming where a subclass provides its own unique implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This is achieved by defining a method in the child class with the same name and parameters as the method in the parent class. While the method signature remains the same, the child class method provides its own specific behavior. This mechanism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling polymorphism.

It serves as a blueprint or template for other classes, defining a common structure and interface. Abstract classes contain one or more abstract methods, which are declared but have no implementation within the class itself. Subclasses that inherit from an abstract class are obligated to provide concrete implementations for all of the abstract methods. This mechanism enforces a consistent structure and interface across related classes, promoting code reusability, improving design, and reducing the likelihood of errors."],"metadata":{"id":"-fMivKaSKL1r"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q16.**What are the advantages of OOP in python?\n","\n","-->OOP in Python brings several advantages:\n","\n","* **Modularity:** Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable units (classes and objects).\n","* **Reusability:** Encourages code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.\n","* **Maintainability:** Easier to understand, modify, and extend code due to better organization.\n","* **Flexibility:** Adapts well to changing requirements due to its inherent flexibility.\n","* **Scalability:** Enables building large and complex systems with manageable complexity.\n","\n","In essence, OOP in Python promotes cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Kzj2kKQhK5sc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q17.**What is the difference vetween a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","-->Class Variable: Shared among all instances of the class.
